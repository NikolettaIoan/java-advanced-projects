Within project management, scrum, sometimes
written Scrum or SCRUM, is a framework for
developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a
complex environment,[1] with an initial emphasis
on software development, although it has been used
in other fields including research, sales, marketing
and advanced technologies.[2] It is designed for
teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work
into goals that can be completed within time-boxed
iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The
scrum team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called
daily scrums (a form of stand-up meeting). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two
further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to
elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve.
The software development term scrum was first used in a 1986 paper titled "The New New
Product Development Game" by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka.[4][5] The paper was
published in the Jan 1986 issue of Harvard Business Review. The term is borrowed
from rugby, where a scrum is a formation of players. The term scrum was chosen by the
paper's authors because it emphasizes teamwork.[6]
Scrum is occasionally seen written in all-capitals, as SCRUM.[7] While the word itself is not
an acronym, its capitalized styling likely comes from an early paper by Ken Schwaber[8] that
capitalized SCRUM in its title.[9][10]
While the trademark on the term scrum itself has been allowed to lapse, it is now deemed
as a generic trademark owned by the wider community rather than an individual.[11]
Many of the terms used in scrum literature are typically written with leading capitals
(e.g., Scrum Master, Daily Scrum), but in many cases should not be capitalized if they
are common nouns. To maintain correct grammar, this article uses normal sentence case
for these terms (e.g., scrum master, daily scrum) â€“ unless they are recognized marks (such
as Certified Scrum Master and Professional Scrum Master)
